This file contains the steps I took to code the area of a circle. 

## My steps 

1) First, I defined the radius:
   double radius = 10.5;

2) Then, I defined the equation:
   double area = Math.pow(radius, 2);
   area = area * Math.PI;

3) Lastly, I finished the code by printing the answer. 
  System.out.print("The area of the circle with radius 10.5 is: ");
  System.out.println(area);
